# uber-react-native
Learning react native by trying to replicate the Uber ride sharing app.

To run this project locally, you would be a Google Maps API key. Once available, plug in that value in the .env file in the project root directory. Make sure to not use quotes.
Once this is done, dp

```
yarn install
```

followed by 

```
yarn ios
```
